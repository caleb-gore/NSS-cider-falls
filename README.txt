****  Where I left off  ****

clicking on park services is working, but the grammar is not displaying correctly.  areaNames function on the services.js file is not properly formmating the html so it prints the string incorrectly.  

Attempting to use the indexOf array method to compare the index of the area to the length of the areas array.  It's not working.  

Last test was console.logging the indexOf each area in the areas array to make sure it returned a number.  It did, however it's still not properly comparing that number to the length of the areas array minus one.  

try refactoring the function to separate the responsibilities of each conditional.  This may solve the problem.
